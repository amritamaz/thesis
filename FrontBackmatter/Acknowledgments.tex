\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

Thank you to Mark Oskin and Luis Ceze, my PhD advisors and indefatigable champions.
I learned a lot from them.
Magda Balazinska, too, whose guiding presence on the LightDB project taught me not only about data management, but also how to drive great research projects.

Thank you to the many UW faculty, industry collaborators, and mentors who taught me a great deal: Jon Barron, Alvin Cheung, David Gallup, Warren Hunt, Anton Kaplanyan, Visvesh Sathe, Steve Seitz.

Thank you to my friends and lab mates Armin Alaghi, Meghan Cowan, Maureen Daum, Emily Furst, Brandon Haynes, Brandon Holt, Sung Kim, Vincent Lee, Ming Liu, Liang Luo, Thierry Moreau, Brandon Myers, Jacob Nelson, Adrian Sampson, Pratyush Patel, Luis Vega, Mark Wyse, Eddie Yan. Special thanks to my friends Kira Goldner, Ellie Levey, Lucy Lin, and Maarten Sap.

Thank you to Elise Dorough, Melody Kadenko, Amanda Robles, and Anna Wehovsky.

Thank you to my parents, for supporting me in a great many things but especially this, and thank you to Gregory T. Woolston for the same.
