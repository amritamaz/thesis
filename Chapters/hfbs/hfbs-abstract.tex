Rendering 3D-360$\degree$ VR video from a camera rig is computation-intensive and typically performed offline.
In this paper, we target the most time-consuming step of the VR video creation process, high-quality flow estimation with the bilateral solver. 
We propose a new algorithm, the hardware-friendly bilateral solver, that enables faster runtimes than existing algorithms of similar quality.
Our algorithm is easily parallelized, achieving a $4\times$ speedup on CPU and $32\times$ speedup on GPU over a baseline CPU implementation. 
We also design an FPGA-based hardware accelerator that utilizes reduced-precision computation and the parallelism inherent in our algorithm to achieve further speedups over our CPU and GPU implementations while consuming an order of magnitude less power. 
The FPGA design's power efficiency enables practical real-time VR video processing at the camera rig or in the cloud.
