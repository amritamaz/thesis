\subsection{Conclusions}
 \label{sec:nsp-conclusion}

In this chapter, we use the notion of ``in-camera processing pipelines'' to thoroughly characterize the design of a highly constrained low-power camera system.
Our results highlight how design parameters for individual accelerators can influence the full-system execution behavior, as well as shape decisions about whether to process a computation block in the camera or offload the computation.
In particular, the inclusion of optional computational blocks---that are not essential for pipeline correctness, but increase overall computational efficiency by generating semantic perceptual information---can lead to significant cost reductions.

Power and performance constraints require increasingly efficient computational platforms, and architects will continue to look to hardware acceleration to enable challenging applications.
% Full-system evaluations can render useless the benefits of tightly-accelerated hardware accelerators, or that in real applications, and
In this section, we show how the benefits of accelerators can be a small fraction of the challenges of data communication in the system.
% As we demonstrate in this paper, even tightly-optimized accelerators can fail to improve performance if they fail to consider full-system communication challenges. % does this make sense? how does the reader know we haven't cherry picked examples?
Given the growth of image data production and requirements of modern vision algorithms, future computational camera applications require such a full system approach to maintain power and performance efficiency.

% We propose evaluating in-camera processing pipelines, a heterogeneous collection of functional blocks at different implementations, to easily assess the most efficient implementation of a power- or performance-constrained image processing workload.
% While prior work has evaluated acceleration units for specific vision or graphics tasks, we focus on modeling and optimizing full-system image-sensor-centric workloads, where a large number of accelerators are available and the choice of when to offload computation is challenging.
% We conduct design space explorations for two applications where in-camera processing is required, and present two specialized solutions -- a sub-mW face authentication SoC for energy harvesting cameras, and a real-time 3D-360$\degree$ stereoscopic virtual reality video assembly from 16 HD cameras.
% For both case studies, we achieved a significant cost reduction, enabling both continuous face authentication on harvested energy and real-time HD panoramic VR video production. More importantly, we believe our technique will continue to enable new classes of applications for high-performance and energy-constrained camera systems.
